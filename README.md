## A Comparative Life-Cycle Assessment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Pathways

The aviation industry faces significant decarbonization challenges due to its heavy dependence on fossil-derived jet fuel. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a key pathway for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in aviation and accelerating progress towards zero-emission goals. This study evaluated the performance of the life-cycle GHG emission measured in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of SAF produced (gCO\textsubscript{2}e / MJ) and the energy return on investment (EROI), the ratio of energy output to energy input (MJ/MJ) of two SAF production pathways: Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) from used cooking oil and soybeans and Alcohol to Jet (ATJ) from corn. The ATJ scenarios modeled did not achieve a 50\% reduction in GHG emissions compared to conventional aviation fuel, while the HEFA scenarios achieved a 48\% to 83\% reduction in emissions.
